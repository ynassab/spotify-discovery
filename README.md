# spotify-discovery
I've had poor experience with Spotify's curation algorithm over the last two years, which recommends music based on very broad genre categories and is unable to identify which qualities of a track I actually enjoy. Finding truly good music is still difficult, but being offered some variety is better than the status quo. Therefore, I wrote a simple program to present me with randomly selected tracks from among the few tens of thousands of most popular tracks in Spotify's database across all available languages.
